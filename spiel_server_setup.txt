:: steps for running on flip ::
1. In back, change port & url for backend in src/API/Server.hs (i.e, make sure if NOT over remote, do not allow that...)
    - for osu: http://access.oregonstate.edu:5167 (DO NOT USE 'orst' for the backend, the requests will fail outright)
2. In back, run ./release_tools/linux/release.sh to rebuild the new server (i.e for a new version)
3. In back, ./spielserver to get it running
4. In back, verify if can be reachable remotely (when connected via the vpn)
    - curl engr.orst.edu:####/test/
5. In front, run "npm install"...
    - if issues, install nvm from here (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    - nvm install 11 (or nvm install 12)
    - node --version should report v11.X.X or v12.X.X
    - Then try "npm install" again
6. In front, change port # in SPIEL_API to match server port, located in src/Run/Run.tsx
7. In front, change port for frontend to something nonstandard in package.json (ex. change start script to "PORT=5168 react-scripts start")
8. Run "npm start" to fire it up
9. Connect to the instance remotely over the indicated port #
